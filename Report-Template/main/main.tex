%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
Popularity is one of important metrics of software projects to be evaluated in large scale software repository. The star count is considered as the representation of popularity of software projects in popular systems like Github. Knowing how many stars the project may get after a duration of time is an interesting feature that the repository can give to the developer. There are works on predicting Github project stars based on different algorithms of Machine Learning (ML) approaches. However, these works relies on features represented how developers commit to their project, which are not be able to see when the project is created. In this work, we propose an alternative scenario, which developers upload a project for first time and the ML model needs to predict the popularity (number of stars) of that project. We relied on features built on the most important part of the project: source code and Abstract Syntax Tree. Our tool achieves \texttt{32\%} as accuracy with star range classification and \texttt{600} as Mean Absolute Error for exact star prediction, which shows challenges along with rooms for improvement in future works. We publish the source code and data at \cite{001} and video presentation at \cite{014}.
