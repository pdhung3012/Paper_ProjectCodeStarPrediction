\section*{Conclusion}
In this research project, we show that predicting the number of  stars and the range of number of stars are challenging problem. The main reason is that representing big code by vector is a brand new problem which current strategies for vectorization are not optimized for. This fact brings room for improvement in future works. Besides, we hope to investigate other vectorization techniques such as CodeToVec \cite{013} and optimize for big code. We also want to try other Deep learning models to see if it can learn better information to predict the popularity of projects.
