\section{Materials}
To implement our approach, we need to train the data from good Github Java projects. There are two criterion we want to focus on. First, the project needs to be developed by well known organizations or strong experiences developers. This will ensure that the code has properly format, correct naming coverage and function properly. Second, the set of projects need to exclude the repetitive projects. In practical, there could be the cases two high quality projects can be forked in the same repository. We select the code corpus provided by Code2Vec \cite{013}. In this research, the author proposed the dataset of 9500 Java projects which is checked and avoid the forked projects manually.
