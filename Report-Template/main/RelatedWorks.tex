In our knowledge, automatic predicting popularity of star by machine learning has been explored by other course projects and research projects in \cite{002,003,004}. In \cite{004}, this project targeted the prediction to classifying unpopular software projects and popular software projects in Python. The author formulated the problem as binary classification with projects have less than 100 stars and greater than or equal to 100 stars. \cite{002,003} solved the problem in a different angle, with predicting the exact star of projects and use popular ML metrics like R2 score for prediction. In both \cite{002,003,004}, they use the features collected from Github system, which measures the number of commits, number of forked projects, number of developers etc. Though they are good features, they are assumed to be obtained along with the number of stars in a specific time. In the other words, if you know the current number of forked projects and number of commits in a software project, you are also know the current star of projects released by Github at the same time. This caused a drawback in a scenario that when you first published the project to Github, you cannot have those features to predict the stars after a range of time. In our approach, we rely on the source code itself to provide features for machine learning.
